# Fabled Lands — Web Edition

A faithful, offline-capable **web port** of the *Fabled Lands* gamebook series. It
renders the original book text and **automates all of the game rules** — dice rolls,
ability checks, combat, markets, ships, and a live Adventure Sheet — the same way the
original Java application ([JaFL](https://flapp.sourceforge.net/)) did, but in
the browser, on any device, with progress saved locally.

> *Fabled Lands* is an open-world gamebook: you roam a fantasy world freely, in any
> order, keeping one character across all the books. There is no single storyline —
> just a huge world of quests, trade, combat and intrigue.

<p align="center"><em>Play it like the printed book — the rules are handled for you.</em></p>

**[Documentation wiki](docs/Home.md)** — player guide, implemented rules, architecture,
build pipeline, testing, the XML tag reference and a corpus census.

## Highlights

- **All six published books** included (~4,400 sections): *The War-Torn Kingdom*,
  *Cities of Gold and Glory*, *Over the Blood-Dark Sea*, *Devils & Howling Darkness*,
  *The Court of Hidden Faces*, and *Lords of the Rising Sun*.
- **Full rules engine** — 2d6 ability checks, difficulty/outcome tables, turn-based
  combat with your live Defence, markets & trading, ships/cargo/crew, blessings, curses,
  codewords, gods, titles, resurrection deals, and the 12-item carry limit.
- **Live Adventure Sheet** that updates itself as you play — including which weapon you
  wield and which armour you wear (an enchanted blade can beat a bigger bonus).
- **Classic-fantasy presentation** — parchment, serif book text, tactile dice.
- **Mobile, tablet & desktop** — responsive; the sheet becomes a slide-in drawer on phones.
- **Installable PWA** — works fully **offline** after first load; add it to your home screen.
- **Read-aloud narration** — optional text-to-speech of the story prose (see below).
- **Saved in your browser** — multiple save slots via `localStorage`; autosaves as you go, with **import/export** of individual saves as files (back up or move a character between devices).
- **Maps** — the world map plus each book's regional map, in an in-game viewer.
- **No backend, no build toolchain, no dependencies** — plain HTML/CSS/ES modules.

```

The `java-engine/` Java project is the original work of Jonathan Mann and is **reference
only**: it is never edited, and none of its code is copied — the JS rules are a clean-room
reimplementation (see [`NOTICE`](NOTICE)). One narrow, deliberate exception exists: task 239
renamed `README.txt` to `README.md` so it renders on GitHub, and updated the matching filename
literal in `Pack.java` so the reference packager stays coherent. Nothing else in that tree has
changed.

---

## Running it

The app uses `fetch` to load the bundled book data, so it must be served over HTTP
(opening `index.html` directly via `file://` will not work in most browsers).

### Locally

Any static file server works. With Python (which ships with most systems), serve
**from the repository root** — the root `index.html` redirects into `web/`:

```bash
python -m http.server 8848
# then open http://localhost:8848/   (redirects to /web/)
```

(You can also serve the `web/` folder directly, or use the VS Code **Live Server** extension.)

### On the web (recommended for mobile/tablet)

`web/` is a self-contained static site. Deploy it to any static host:

- **GitHub Pages** — publish the `web/` folder (or set Pages to serve `/web`).
- **Netlify / Cloudflare Pages / Vercel** — drag-and-drop or point at the `web/` directory.

Once loaded on a phone or tablet, use the browser's **“Add to Home Screen”** to install
it as an app. Thanks to the service worker it then runs entirely offline; your saved
games live in that browser.

### Deep-link / preview

`?demo=<book>.<section>` starts a default Warrior at that section — handy for testing or
sharing a spot, e.g. `…/index.html?demo=1.10`.

`?seed=<value>` makes every dice roll deterministic for that page load (any string or
number works), so a run is reproducible and manual testing is repeatable — e.g.
`…/index.html?seed=42&demo=1.10`. Omit it for normal random play.

---

## Regenerating the data

`web/data/*.json` is compiled from `books/` and `rules/`. If you edit or add section XML,
rebuild it with **PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) — no Node required**:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/build-data.ps1
```

The build requires pwsh 7, not the Windows `powershell` (5.1): under 5.1 `ConvertTo-Json`
and the culture-aware `Sort-Object` would silently reformat every book JSON and the version
stamp, so both scripts carry `#Requires -Version 7.0` and 5.1 refuses to run them. Only this
offline build step needs pwsh 7 — the shipped web app has no runtime dependencies.

This reads every numeric `books/book<n>/<section>.xml`, each book's `Adventurers.xml`
(starting stats/items) and the rules, then writes one compact JSON file per book plus
`meta.json`. Non-section files (`*temp.xml`, `*old.xml`, pregen character files) are
skipped. Book text is left untouched; the JSON simply bundles it so the app can load a
whole book in a single request and cache it for offline play.

Before bundling, the build **validates the source XML** (`build/validate-source.ps1`), and
any problem **aborts the build** — naming the file — instead of shipping data that would
only misbehave when the browser renders that section:

- **Well-formed** and rooted at the element its kind requires: `<section>` for a section
  file, the rules files and a pregen biography; `<adventurers>` for `Adventurers.xml`.
- Each section's `<section name>` **matches its filename** — a purely numeric file must
  match exactly, while a lettered continuation (e.g. `448a`, `609a`) may use either its
  full name or its printed parent number.
- A **closed tag/attribute/value vocabulary**: an unknown tag, an unknown attribute for
  that tag, a truth flag that isn't `t`/`f`, or an invalid enumerated value (ability,
  blessing, cargo, crew, gender, profession, ship, `tick special=`, per-tag `type=`) fails
  the build. Historically these shipped as silent no-ops (`safeAddGodd`, `tag=` for
  `tags=`). A genuinely new name must be added to the allowlist in the same change that
  teaches the engine to read it.
- Every **explicit jump target resolves**: a `section=` (or `<extrachoice atsection=`) in a
  bundled book 1–6 must name a section that book actually contains. Links into the
  unbundled books 7–12 are intentional and left alone, as are non-literal ids.
- Every **`codeword=` value is a codeword some book declares**, checked against the union of
  the six `books/book<N>/book.ini` `Codewords=` lists, on the **exact spelling, case
  included** — both rule engines compare codewords case-sensitively, so `codeword="anchor"`
  is not the declared `Anchor`. A misspelling is invisible otherwise —
  `<gain codeword="Anchr">` against `<if codeword="Anchor">` builds and renders clean, and the
  branch simply never opens. Section-scoped bookkeeping flags (`2.567.1a`, `5/520`), the
  port's own named state flags and codewords printed in books 7–12 are exempt. The reverse
  direction prints as a **note** and never fails the build, in **two grades that are not the
  same finding**: a declared codeword *no section mentions at all* (usually nothing to fix —
  the printed books do list spare names), and one that sections test or clear but no
  `<gain>`/`<tick>`/`<set>`/`<outcome>` ever gives, which means a transcription dropped an
  award.
- Each pregen's **biography is readable** — inline prose, or the `<FirstName>.xml` whose
  first `<p>` the build folds in.

The gate is itself tested: `pwsh -File build/validate-selftest.ps1` runs it over a fixture
tree, once clean and then once per class of mistake (CI runs this on every push). The real
corpus is clean, so a gate that quietly stopped catching typos would otherwise look exactly
like a passing build.

### Which books a build ships — `books.ini`

`books/books.ini` holds two lists: `Books=` is the twelve-title series registry (used for
titles only), and **`Published=` is the set of books this build actually bundles**. That one
line drives everything downstream — source validation, the per-book JSON, the copied
regional maps and illustrations, `sw.js`'s offline precache inventory, and the smoke suite's
every-section scan — so publishing a book is a **content** change (drop in the folder, add
its number, `<N>.Path=` and `<N>.Title=`) rather than a build-script edit. It is deliberately
an explicit list and not a `books/book*/` glob, which would bundle a half-transcribed folder
the moment it appeared.

The line is **validated before anything is written**: a non-numeric, zero or duplicated
entry, or a published book missing its `Title=`, `Path=` or source directory, aborts the
build instead of quietly producing a partial edition. Taking a book back off the line
**removes its generated outputs** (`web/data/book<N>.json`, `web/assets/maps/book<N>.jpg`
and its copied illustrations), so a withdrawal can't leave a stale bundle that CI's
rebuild-and-diff gate is blind to.

**A file is build-owned if a build inventory listed it, or a book folder supplies its name** —
the previous build's inventory is read out of `sw.js` before the new one is written, so a
generated copy is still recognised as output after its *source* has been deleted or renamed.
The same reconcile drops a still-published book's map when its `-Map` source goes and
`web/assets/world-map.jpg` when `images/world-map.jpg` does. Manual illustration drop-ins
(below) are in neither set and are never touched.

`web/sw.js` therefore has one **generated region** — the `BOOK_DATA` / `BOOK_MAPS` /
`BOOK_ILLUS` lists between its `BEGIN`/`END GENERATED BOOK INVENTORY` markers, spread into
`REQUIRED` and `OPTIONAL`. Don't hand-edit them (or remove the markers — the build fails
loudly if they're gone); everything else in `sw.js` is ordinary hand-written source.
`pwsh -File build/release-selftest.ps1` drives all of this over fixtures, including a real
build of a temp tree that publishes and then withdraws an added book — run for a book number
inside the twelve-book series and one outside it (CI runs it).

The bundled text is **LF-normalised**, so the JSON is a pure function of the source
*content* rather than of the builder's checkout: a `core.autocrlf=true` working tree
(CRLF) bundles byte-for-byte identically to an LF one. Nothing is lost — XML parsers,
both the build's and the browser's `DOMParser`, normalise CRLF to LF while parsing
anyway. This is what lets CI check the committed data against a clean rebuild (task 197):
the smoke workflow runs `build-data.ps1` on Linux and **fails on any generated diff** in
`web/data`, `web/assets`, `version.js` or `sw.js` before testing, so an XML edit committed
without a rebuild can no longer pass by exercising the stale bundle. Keep both build
scripts OS-neutral (forward slashes in path literals) so that job keeps working.

### Build stamp / version

A build version in the form `yy.MM.dd.<hash>` (date + a short SHA-1 digest of the app
source) is shown at the bottom of the in-game menu (and on the title screen). It is generated
into `web/js/version.js`. Because the digest is derived from **content**, it changes on any
edit to the app — not only on a new commit — so returning visitors' service workers always
see a fresh cache key after a deploy. After changing anything in `web/`, refresh it with:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/stamp-version.ps1
```

(`build-data.ps1` runs this automatically at the end.)

The stamp identifies content, so identical content always yields an identical stamp — which
takes some care to get right (task 196):

- Digest inputs are **repo-relative paths sorted ordinally**, and text is **LF-normalised**
  before hashing, so neither the machine's locale nor a `core.autocrlf=true` checkout can
  change the digest. Renaming a file does change it.
- `sw.js` is **included**, with only its generated `VERSION = …` line swapped for a fixed
  placeholder in memory. A service-worker-only release therefore gets a new version identity,
  while re-stamping the cache key stays non-circular.
- The **date is reused while the digest is unchanged**, so re-running the build on a later day
  with no source change is a byte-for-byte no-op: no dirty tree, and no pointless cache
  eviction for installed players. A new date is only chosen for a genuine change.

## Narration (text-to-speech)

Story prose can be read aloud using the browser's built-in **Web Speech API** — no
backend, no API keys, no cost, and it keeps working offline with the device's own voices.

- A **🔊 button** in the game header plays/stops narration of the current section.
- **Auto-narrate** (on by default) reads each new section as you arrive; toggle it, pick a
  **voice**, and set the **speed** under **Menu → Narration…** (remembered per browser).
- Prose is spoken sentence-by-sentence (so long passages aren't truncated) and the current
  sentence is **highlighted**; button/roll/choice labels are excluded from the reading.

It is a **self-contained, optional module** ([web/js/tts.js](web/js/tts.js)). Every
integration point in `app.js` is tagged with a `[TTS]` comment, so the feature can be
removed entirely by deleting that module and those few lines — the game is unaffected.
If a browser has no speech support, the button simply doesn't appear.

## How it works

The app parses each section's original XML in the browser with `DOMParser` and walks the
tree into interactive DOM. There is no lossy XML→JSON transform — the mixed prose-and-logic
structure of the books is preserved exactly.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `data.js` | Loads the bundled JSON, parses section XML, exposes `getSection(book, n)`; publishes the bundled-book list into `edition.js`. |
| `edition.js` | Which books this build bundles — a tiny, import-free registry `data.js` writes and the rule modules read, so a `book=` gate needs no XML loader (and therefore no `DOMParser`) on the engine's import graph. No DOM. |
| `state.js` | The **Adventure Sheet** model + derived stats (affected abilities, Defence) + `localStorage` save slots. |
| `rules.js` | Static constants: abilities, professions, rank titles, limits. |
| `engine.js` | The headless rules core: dice, `<if>` condition evaluation, passive effects (`lose`/`tick`/`gain`/`set`/`curse`), die-roll modifiers (`<adjust>`, conditional on crew/ship/god/item/codeword/rank), and roll resolution (ability/difficulty, rank check, training), rest, and resurrection deals. No DOM. |
| `combat.js` | Headless combat resolution — building an enemy, attack rounds, initiative, damage, `<fightdamage>`. No DOM. |
| `market.js` | Headless economy — buying/selling goods, weapons, armour, ships, cargo, and crew upgrades. No DOM. |
| `render.js` | Turns a `<section>` tree into interactive DOM and wires all interactions, delegating the actual rules to `engine.js` / `combat.js` / `market.js` / `render-rules.js`. |
| `render-rules.js` | DOM-free section-render decisions the renderer used to encode inline: blessing veto / spend / guarded-loss rules, and reward/payment eligibility (choose-one, priced item award, roll-gate, forced/optional actions, reward-waste). No DOM. |
| `render-gates.js` | DOM-free navigation-gate computation: which onward navigations to hold behind an unresolved fight / mandatory roll / forced transfer, and which post-fight effects to defer. The renderer tags and disables the buttons. No DOM. |
| `visit-state.js` | DOM-free per-visit execution-context (ctx) + return-frame serialization (create/flatten/rebuild) so a save resumes the exact visit. No DOM. |
| `render-util.js` | Small dependency-free display helpers (title-case, item labels, HTML-escape, market titles) shared by `render.js` and the view modules. No DOM. |
| `render-rolls.js` | The roll + branch **view** — dice widgets (`<difficulty>/<random>/<rankcheck>/<training>/<reroll>`) and the success/failure/outcomes reveal — plain functions taking the story first. Resolution rules stay in `render-rules.js`/`engine.js`. |
| `render-rewards.js` | The passive-effect, payment, reward and item-award **view** — the `renderPassive` verdict switch, groups, chooser effects, forced/optional & pay-to-spin buttons, choose-one rewards, and item/replace awards — plain functions taking the story first. The execution model + eligibility rules stay in `render-rules.js`; award transactions in `engine.js`/`market.js`. |
| `render-choices.js` | The choice + navigation **view** — the `<choices>` table, `<choice>` buttons, `<goto>`/`<return>` links and the sail-ship chooser — plain functions taking the story first. Eligibility/payment rules stay in `render-rules.js`; the fight/roll/transfer nav tagging and `goBack()` stay on the Story (section lifecycle). |
| `render-combat.js` | The fight **view** — single/group battle widgets and per-round Attack/Flee/blessing controls — plain functions taking the story first. Combat rules stay in `combat.js`. |
| `render-market.js` | The economy **view** — markets, inline buy/sell, rest, money/item caches, transfers, resurrection deals — plain functions taking the story first. Economy rules stay in `market.js`/`engine.js`. |
| `ui.js` | Adventure-Sheet panel, dice animation, modals, toasts. |
| `app.js` | Bootstrap, screens, routing, character creation, death/resurrection, saves. |
| `sw-cache.js` | The service worker's cache-namespace policy — which `fl-*` caches are obsolete, the current-then-older lookup, and the "prune only after a complete install" gate. CacheStorage is shared per origin, so nothing here ever touches a co-hosted app's cache. Loaded by `sw.js` via `importScripts`; no DOM. |

The rules were deliberately split **out of the renderer**: `render.js` builds DOM and
handles clicks, while all game logic lives in DOM-free modules (`engine.js`, `combat.js`,
`market.js`, `render-rules.js`, `render-gates.js`). This keeps the rules unit-testable in isolation — `web/_test.html` exercises
combat, economy, rolls and effects directly, without touching the DOM.

### The rendering model

Each section is **re-rendered on every state change**. Passive effects and completed dice
rolls are memoised per-visit by a stable node path, which guarantees that:

- passive effects (money, codewords, stamina…) apply **exactly once** per visit;
- conditionals re-evaluate against **live** state after each roll;
- a roll's `<success>`/`<failure>`/`<outcome>` branch only appears — and only applies its
  effects — once the roll is actually made.

Two behaviours follow the original Java app rather than a simpler "hide it" approach:

- **Conditionals are shown, not hidden.** An `<if>`/`<elseif>`/`<else>` branch whose
  condition isn't met is **greyed out and disabled** rather than removed — so
  "*If you have the codeword X…*" stays on screen for context and the following "If not…"
  still reads correctly. Its effects don't apply and its links are inert until (a later
  state change makes) the condition hold.
- **Money is spent by choice.** A `<lose>` of Shards/goods in a section that lets the
  player decline (it offers an optional "turn back" link) is **not** deducted on arrival;
  it becomes a **click-to-pay** action that blocks the rest of the section until resolved —
  mirroring the original's forced-action model, so turning back costs nothing. Unavoidable
  payments and narrative losses (Stamina, codewords, blessings…) still apply automatically.

### Rules implemented (from the original engine)

- **Ability check** — `2d6 + affected ability > Difficulty` ⇒ success.
- **Combat** — you attack with `2d6 + Combat` vs the foe's Defence (damage = the excess);
  the foe strikes back vs your **Defence = Combat (incl. weapon) + Rank + best armour**.
  `<fightdamage>` effects fire when the enemy wounds you. Stamina 0 = death.
- **Outcome tables** — roll `N`d6 and map the total onto ranges (`0-4`, `1,2`, `11`, `14+`).
- **Rank check** (`roll ≤ Rank`), **Training** (`2d6 > current ability` ⇒ +1).
- **Economy** — markets buy/sell items, weapons, armour, tools, ships, cargo and crew
  upgrades (one grade at a time); inline `<buy>`/`<sell>` in prose, including cargo grants
  and cargo-for-cargo barter (give any one unit, receive the offered commodity);
  best-bonus-only stacking; 12-item carry limit (money is unlimited).
- **Bookkeeping** — codewords, blessings, curses, gods, titles, flags, variables, visit
  boxes, caches and resurrection deals.

## What's included & known limits

- **Books 1–6** are fully playable. Links to **Books 7–12** (never digitised here) are
  detected and shown as a friendly “not included in this edition” message rather than a
  dead end.
- **Regional maps** for all six books are included (each book folder's `<Region>-Map.jpg`,
  copied to `web/assets/maps/book<N>.jpg` by the build) and shown in the in-game **Maps**
  viewer alongside the world map.
- **Section illustrations**: the three illustrations referenced by an `<image>` tag —
  book 1's *Forest of the Forsaken*, book 3's *Map of Bazalek Isle*, and book 5's *The Black
  Diptych* — live beside their book XML and are copied to `web/assets/illus/` by the build,
  where `render.js` displays them. The **general per-section art** (e.g. `142.jpg`) is not
  part of this repository, so that inline art is skipped gracefully. If you obtain those
  files, drop them in `web/assets/illus/` named as the XML references them (e.g. `142.jpg`)
  and they will appear automatically.
- The engine covers the full common rule set. A handful of very rare, bespoke section
  mechanics degrade gracefully (text still shows; unknown tags render their prose).
- New games begin at **Book 1, §1** with that book's starting profile (1st Rank, 9 Stamina,
  16 Shards); you can also pick a different starting book in character creation.

## Testing

`web/_test.html` is a headless smoke test: it creates a character, exercises the engine 
(conditions, effects, dice, ranges, combat), verifies interactions (rolling, choosing,
fighting), and renders **every section of every published book** (today's six) to confirm
none throw — the scan reads the book list out of `meta.json`, so it follows `books.ini`'s
`Published=` line rather than a hardcoded 1–6. Serve the repo root and open
`/web/_test.html`, or run the whole thing headlessly with one command:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/run-tests.ps1            # whole harness
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/run-tests.ps1 -Suite actions,economy
```

It serves the tree through [`build/serve.py`](build/serve.py), drives Chrome headless, prints
the verdict and **exits 0 only on `RESULT ALL PASS`**; on a failure it prints the first 25
`FAIL`/`FATAL` lines and keeps the dumped DOM, naming its path. It also closes the loop's
false-pass traps rather than leaving them to be remembered — see the notes below.

A run that Chrome's `--virtual-time-budget` cuts short fails in *another* component's name (as a
suite error, or as the bootstrap abort that "`RESULT FATAL pass=0 fail=1`" otherwise denotes), so
the runner recognises both shapes and says it was the clock, with `-VirtualTimeBudget` to raise
it. That budget is not a wall-clock timeout — virtual time leaps ahead whenever the page is idle,
so the default carries headroom for free. The wall clock is `-BrowserTimeoutSeconds` (default
300): a browser that *hangs* rather than exits never reaches the page and never spends the
budget, so the runner bounds the launch itself and fails naming the hang instead of waiting
forever.

The first line of the dumped `#results` reads
`RESULT ALL PASS …` when healthy (page title
`TESTS_OK`); any failure, or any uncaught async error / unhandled promise rejection captured
during the run, reports `RESULT FAILURES`/`RESULT FATAL` and title `TESTS_FAIL` — the fatal
state is sticky and can never be overwritten by a later "ALL PASS".

`_test.html` itself is just the harness + reporter; the assertions live in focused ES-module
suites under [`web/tests/`](web/tests), each exporting one `async run(ctx)` and rebuilding its
own fixtures so it runs in isolation. They execute in this order (the six-book scan runs last):

| Suite | File | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engine`    | `tests/suite-engine.js`    | conditions, effects, dice, rank checks, caches/transfer, resurrection |
| `render`    | `tests/suite-render.js`    | section render + interaction: rolls, choices, fights, pays, choose-one |
| `inventory` | `tests/suite-inventory.js` | adventure sheet, afflictions, items, ships, blessings, RNG/expr parsing |
| `combat`    | `tests/suite-combat.js`    | current-vessel rules, combat blessings, fightrounds, fights, roll branches |
| `economy`   | `tests/suite-economy.js`   | markets, rest, TTS, persistence, item effects, rewards, quantity/replace |
| `actions`   | `tests/suite-actions.js`   | travel gates, transfers, `<return>` restore, curse lift, blessing veto |
| `corpus`    | `tests/suite-corpus.js`    | renders **every section of all six books** without throwing (final scan) |

Append `?suite=<name>` (or a comma list, e.g. `?suite=combat,economy`) to run a focused
subset in the same harness — handy for iterating on one area.

### The DOM-free seam, checked in Node

The rule modules are supposed to be importable and unit-checkable straight from Node, with no
DOM and no shims. One extra import is all it takes to break that silently, so the promise is
tested rather than trusted:

```bash
node web/tests/node-import.mjs      # exit 0 = pass; no dependencies
```

It walks each rule module's import graph and fails if it reaches anything that touches the
browser, then really imports all seven (`engine`, `combat`, `market`, `state`, `render-rules`,
`render-gates`, `visit-state`) and calls into them. CI runs it as its own job.
