#Requires -Version 7.0

  release-selftest.ps1
  --------------------
  Drives release.ps1 over fixtures so the edition manifest is tested instead of trusted
  (task 209). Three parts:

    1. books.ini validation - one case per class of malformed, duplicated or dangling
       Published= entry, plus the shapes that must still be accepted.
    2. The service worker's generated offline inventory - a publish set in, the three
       precache lists out, byte-identical on a no-op re-run.
    3. A REAL build of a fixture tree, both directions of an added-book transition, once per
       number in $ADDED: adding a book must reach meta.json, its bundled data and the
       offline inventory; withdrawing it must delete exactly its own generated files and
       nothing else.

  Nothing under books/ or web/ is touched: every fixture is built in a temp directory and
  removed afterwards (build-data.ps1 takes -Root for exactly this).

  Run: pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/release-selftest.ps1   (exit 0 = pass)

  ASCII-only and OS-neutral (forward slashes), like the other build scripts.

# build-data.ps1 runs against it with -Root, so this exercises the actual validation,
# bundling, copy, reconcile and inventory steps rather than a re-implementation of them. The
# tree is regenerated, and the whole transition run, once per number in $ADDED.
#
# Each book needs its book.ini for the same reason a real one does: the codeword gate reads
# Codewords= as a UNION over the published books, so a book that declares none is an error
# that disarms the value check for every book (task 325). A fixture without it fails the
# build before any assertion below can run - which is what it did until task 333.
