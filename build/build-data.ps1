#Requires -Version 7.0
# The build requires PowerShell 7 (pwsh). Under Windows PowerShell 5.1 the outputs
# diverge silently: ConvertTo-Json escapes non-ASCII differently and the culture-aware
# Sort-Object reorders the stamp inputs, so 5.1 would rewrite every book JSON and the
# version stamp. The #Requires line makes 5.1 refuse to run (with a clear message)
# instead of producing a divergent build. Run: pwsh -File build/build-data.ps1 (task 121)
<#
  build-data.ps1
  ---------------
  Bundles the Fabled Lands source data (book section XML, per-book starting
  characters, and the rules) into the JSON files the web app loads at runtime,
  copies the world + regional maps, and refreshes the build stamp.

  Source of truth is left untouched:
    books/book<n>/<s>.xml         -> web/data/book<n>.json  ( { "<section>": "<xml>" } )
    books/book<n>/Adventurers.xml -> folded into web/data/meta.json
    rules/*.xml                   -> folded into web/data/meta.json
    books/books.ini               -> book titles in meta.json, and the Published= list
                                     of book numbers this build bundles (which also drives
                                     sw.js's generated offline inventory)
    images/world-map.jpg          -> web/assets/world-map.jpg
    books/book<n>/<Region>-Map.*  -> web/assets/maps/book<n>.jpg

  Run from the repository root (requires PowerShell 7 - see #Requires below):
      pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/build-data.ps1

  CI runs this same script on Linux to check the committed output against a clean rebuild
  (task 197), so keep it OS-neutral: forward slashes in path literals (a 'web\data' literal
  becomes a file called "web\data" on Linux, not a directory) and no reliance on the checkout's
  line endings. It is deliberately dependency-free - stock pwsh 7, no modules.

# it to the line) rather than a build-script edit. It is deliberately an explicit list and
# not a books/book*/ glob: a half-transcribed book folder would otherwise be bundled the
# moment it appeared - reaching meta.json and the in-game book picker, and failing the
# closed-vocabulary gate. An explicit list keeps work-in-progress in-tree and inert.
# (Books= is the 12-title series registry, not the publish set; the build ignores it.)
